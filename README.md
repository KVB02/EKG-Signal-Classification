# EKG-Signal-Classification

## Project Description

This project applies neural networks to classify EKG signals, aiming to automate the detection of heart conditions. The core of the project lies in a detailed Python script and an accompanying Jupyter notebook that outlines the entire process from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Technologies Used

Python: The primary programming language for implementing the neural network model.
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For generating visualizations of the data and results.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/KVB02/EKG-Signal-Classification.git
cd EKG-Signal-Classification
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Script Execution: Navigate to the src directory and run python ekg_classifier.py to execute the neural network model.
Jupyter Notebook: Open EKG_Classification.ipynb for a comprehensive walkthrough of the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Notebook Overview

EKG_Classification.ipynb provides a step-by-step guide through the project's methodology, highlighting key insights and findings. It serves as an educational tool for understanding the nuances of EKG signal classification.
